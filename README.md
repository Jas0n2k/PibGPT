## The Story Behind the Name

This project is lovingly named after our pranked friend, "铁大比" (Iron Big). We playfully reversed the nickname and grabbed the first two letters, resulting in "Pbi" (Prank Big Iron).

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** [Vue3](https://vuejs.org
) + TypeScript with a sprinkle of [NaiveUI](https://www.naiveui.com/)
* **Backend:** Express with vanilla JavaScript
